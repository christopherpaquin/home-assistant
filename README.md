#Simple Setup and Configuration for Home Assistant

In this repo you will find my simple configuration examples for my home deployment of Home Assistant (https://home-assistant.io/).

##Getting Started

This is a simple configuration using the following files

+configuration.yaml - Main Configuration File
+secrets.yaml - For all passwords and keys - not checked into git
+includes/customize.yaml - For all customizations (setting friendly_names and custom icons)
+includes/groups - For all Groups
